<p>The simplest way to do what you want is ensuring that both terms are tables in the first place.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>local a = "a string"&#xA;local b = {"a table", "containing", "a string"}&#xA;&#xA;...&#xA;&#xA;-- Make sure that a is a table&#xA;if type(a) ~= 'table' then a = {a} end&#xA;&#xA;if a == b then -- now you can use metatables here&#xA;...&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I must warn you against doing this. If, as you said, you want to 'check that a is inside b', I would not use the equality operator for that. Instead, I would use something more explicit, like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>if tableContains(b,a) then -- this is less confusing; equality doesn't mean composition&#xA;...&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

<p>I want to write some code to do acoustic analysis and I'm trying to determine the proper tool(s) for the job. I would normally write something like this in Python using numpy and scipy and possibly Cython for the analysis part. I've discovered that the world of Python audio libraries is a bit chaotic, with scads of very limited packages in various states of development.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've also come across a bunch of audio/acoustic specific languages like SuperCollider, Faust, etc. that seem to make the audio processing easy but may be limited in terms of IO and analysis capability.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm currently working on Linux with Alsa and PulseAudio installed by default. I would prefer not to involve and of the various and sundry other audio packages like Jack if possible, though that is not a hard requirement.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My primary interest in this question is to determine whether there is a domain specific language that will provide for quicker prototyping and testing or whether a general language like Python is more appropriate. Thanks.</p>&#xA;

<p>The way I'm reading your question, you're doing a <code>union</code>, and you want to see which value is in table A, and which is in table B. If that's the case, then creating your category is very easy, as you just specify the value you want for the table you're in. Like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>select&#xA;    name,&#xA;    period,&#xA;    value,&#xA;    '1' as category&#xA;from&#xA;    A&#xA;union all&#xA;select&#xA;    name,&#xA;    period,&#xA;    value,&#xA;    '2' as category&#xA;from&#xA;    B&#xA;order by&#xA;    name, period, category&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

<p>You would normally call C library wrappers for the system calls (for example open() and read() are just wrappers). Wrappers are more friendly.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As an alternative to do the work yourself in assembly, you can try the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/syscall" rel="nofollow">syscall(2)</a> function from glibc.

all
my setup
we are storing lat lng as decimal values up to 6 decimal places in database which are mapped in the domain model loaded entity as decimal values of lat lng
in the application though we use a class location that performs operations on lat lng which are in double format because the .net math api works in doubles
therefore when we load lat lng from database in decimal it ends used by the application as double s
and that s the problem
conversion of double - dec rounding occurs and i know why it happens so what s the best work around this
example of the problem
the rounding is a problem in cases where a user entered a lat in component form dms and after the conversion and saving the lat into database a different value is saved
when it is loaded back and viewed by the user in component form it is not what he entered initially
ex
user entered n10-01-03.5
when loaded back n10-01-03.468 caused by dbl - dec conversion
possible solutions
1 use decimals for lat lng in my location class and every time i do a calculation i would convert lat lng from dec - dbl and then back to dec
2 store lat lng as doubles in the database not sure if this will be a problem in the future
we want accuracy to 6 decimal places

Please take a look at my code below: &#xA;HTML:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>                &lt;label&gt;&#xA;                  &lt;input type="checkbox" id="consentForEmail" name="consentForEmail" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#xA;                  &lt;span class="wpcf7-list-item-label"&gt;By clicking this button I agree to receive emails from us&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;                &lt;/label&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>JavaScript for collecting and setting the value:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>    var _this = '#consentForEmail';&#xA;&#xA;    $('#consentForEmail').change(function(){&#xA;      var checked = $('#consentForEmail').prop('checked');&#xA;      $(_this).val(checked);&#xA;      console.log( $('#consentForEmail').val() );&#xA;    });&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And finally, PHP for collecting form data:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>$receive_email = $_POST["consentForEmail"];&#xA;echo "&lt;li&gt;$receive_email&lt;/li&gt;"&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you! </p>&#xA;

<p>Hello guys so my code is supposed to create an unlimited amount of processes each running their own program and communicating threw pipes..</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is done in a recursive way so that the first parent creates a pipe then a child..

<p>Looking at the <code>titlePanel</code> function, it looks like the first argument is <code>title</code> and the second is a boolean. What you're doing is passing two separate arguments, so the "My Title" is being used as the value for the <code>windowTitle</code> parameter. You want both the image and the text to be treated as tags, as one parameter, so try something like</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code> titlePanel(&#xA;   tagList(&#xA;     img(src = "./mylogo.png", height = 60, width = 255),&#xA;     "My Title"&#xA;   )&#xA;  ),&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Note: I didn't try running this, and I'm not 100% sure this will work because it's possible that this is only meant to host text because the function documentation says the parameter is <code>an application title to display</code>.

<p>one way to do this would be to introduce one extra loop that iterates the algorithm over all the nodes, and with distance array you can store the "via node" element.&#xA;once you have shortest path calculated from each node to every other node, all you have to do is to follow the "via node" value that you have stored.&#xA;btw, in terms of efficiency, this algorithm sucks, it's O(n^3).</p>&#xA;

<p><code>B</code> is a (nested) class template with a <code>bool</code> template parameter (<code>b</code>); its static member <code>m_n</code> is <code>1</code> when <code>b</code> is <code>true</code>, and <code>0</code> when <code>b</code> is <code>false</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><code>t &gt; T()</code> tests whether the value <code>t</code> (which is a template parameter of <code>A</code>) is greater than a value-initialised <code>T</code>. Since <code>T</code> must be a valid type for non-type template parameters, <code>T()</code> is equivalent to <code>T(0)</code>, i.e. a zero expressed in the correct type.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The result of that test is then used as a template argument for <code>B</code>. Equivalent code would look like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>public:&#xA;    static const T t0 = T();&#xA;    static const bool b1 = t &gt; t0;&#xA;    static const bool b2 = t &lt; t0;&#xA;    static const int m_value = B&lt;b1&gt;::m_n - B&lt;b2&gt;::m_n;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

<p>We are exposing the Entity objects through WCF Services. To retrieve the entities we make several requests through WCF, close to a 100 or more. We recently switched to Digest Authentication and noticing that every single server request is issuing a 401. This creating twice as much load on the server and since we have very large "posts", this will create additional traffic lag. The goal is to have only a single Challenge(401) from the server and the rest of the requests should include the Auth header so the server doesn't issue a 401. Since Digest is a challenge based protocol with an expiring nonce, even though we may not fully eliminate the 401's but at least avoid them for every request. Since we control both server and client we want send the Digest Auth header included on every request.&#xA;There is a Pre-Authenticate property in .NET 2.0 webservices Style Web Reference Proxy/Client(that inherits SOAPHttpClientProtocol) that allows the Auth header to be included with the request, but with a WCF Services Web Reference client(that uses ChannelFactory) there isn't. There is a clear difference in the Request/Response traffic when this property is set and when it isn't. Since this is Digest Authentication(NOT Basic) I cannot add the Auth header manually during BeginRequest with a ClientMessageInspector.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>    NetworkCredential creds = new NetworkCredential("username", "pass", "domain");&#xA;&#xA;    //using .NET 2.0 "Web Reference" Style client that uses inherits SoapHttpClientProtocol:&#xA;    webReferenceClient = new Service1();&#xA;    webReferenceClient.Credentials = creds;&#xA;    //**Pre Authenticate **&#xA;    webReferenceClient.PreAuthenticate = true;&#xA;    string resp1 = "";&#xA;    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3;i++) &#xA;        resp1 = resp1 + webReferenceClient.SayHello("jack");&#xA;&#xA;    //using WCF "Service Reference" Client that uses ChannelFactory&#xA;    serviceReferenceClient = new Service1Client();&#xA;&#xA;    serviceReferenceClient.ClientCredentials.HttpDigest.ClientCredential = creds;&#xA;    serviceReferenceClient.ClientCredentials.HttpDigest.AllowedImpersonationLevel =          TokenImpersonationLevel.Impersonation;&#xA;&#xA;    string resp="";&#xA;    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3;i++) &#xA;        resp = resp + serviceReferenceClient.SayHello("jack");&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Fiddler trace with .NET 2.0 Style Web Reference Client, with Preauthenticate set.

from your updated question
how one would make an array of integers 1 2 3 4 .. 1000
in the for loop
the program will iterate the value in variable i start from 0 i 0 until i is less than or equal with 1000 i 1000
on each iteration you can see from the third param in the for loop i++ the program will add 1 to the value of i
it is the same with i i + 1
so by thought it will run like this
i m taking the code below from one people who answered this question
after explaining how for loop works now you can see the declaration of the array of integer as a variable where we store the data
int numbers 1001 means that we declare an array variable sized of 1001 integer value start from index 0 to index 1000
by illustration it will be like
the number inside the tag is the index number of array variable and inside the for loop you can see each index from array variable numbers is assigned by the value of variable i
hope this helps

i noticed something strange related to the drag drop component from anders melander and i wonder if anybody has an idea
i have been looking for the reason without much success
however the effect is 100 repeatable by simply removing from the project s constructor
the other day i noticed that the drop down box on my application was not looking right
whereas it previously looked correct like this
so i started going back to figure out at what time the look of the component broke and i have now been able to trace the change in look 100 to
if this line is present the look is good
if i remove this line of code from the form s constructor the look of the drop box is wrong
i actually wanted to remove dropfiletarget completely from my project since i now use another method to catch a dragged file
can anybody please tell me what register does here to change the look of the component so that i can set the look back to what it should be
my gut says it has to do with theme support as well somehow
additional information based on the comments
i did some tests
a normal looking combobox with theme support looks like this
with theme support disabled it looks like this
in other words the drag drop component s register creates a special look that i had grown used to and of which i thought was the correct look
the canvas where the text is displayed is white instead of grey default settings
i m now torn between going for how it should be or trying to create the look i had gotten used to
anybody knows what properties i should change to get the component-influenced look second screenshot from the top

<p>Need some guidance here, I have two operational esri js maps that I want to combine to have two different popups. If I/we could somehow figure out a way to add the number of parks to the census popup that would work and not worry about the two popups. But I'd prefer to have info on census groups as well as parks plus number of parks in one census block group in the demographics popup. So I'll add the work I've done to create the two working maps and then post the work I've done trying to combine them which is not working. Any help would be very much appreciated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This first example is parks in Pierce County, WA with a popup with park details.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="http://students.washington.edu/sbuffor/infowindow_w_parkname.html" rel="nofollow">http://students.washington.edu/sbuffor/infowindow_w_parkname.html</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Second is the code for census block groups with demographics information for the same area.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="http://students.washington.edu/sbuffor/census_vs_parks.html" rel="nofollow">http://students.washington.edu/sbuffor/census_vs_parks.html</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Last but certainly not least is my attempt at combining the two pieces. This includes adding all the different require statements and functions from both and the majority of the code from each with duplicate pieces removed. I have tried moving things around to map the map render with no luck. I want to preserve the locatebutton and the search bar that are used to find addresses in this as well for added functionality. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="http://students.washington.edu/sbuffor/combined_census_parks.html" rel="nofollow">http://students.washington.edu/sbuffor/combined_census_parks.html</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&#xA;&lt;head&gt;&#xA;

<p>Two ways i can see:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>First, create a hidden field in the form. And populate its value with the <code>tag_names</code> through Jquery.

<p>I have a website I am trying to convert to an iPad application.  I am new to iPad/iPhone development and I am not sure what type of object is the best to use.  The website is <a href="http://www.distripplanner.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.distripplanner.com</a>.  If you look at section #3 (Choose Your Restaurants), the number of rows changes dynamically with number of days for the trip - with a max of 30 days.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My application is set up as a single-view application and I have my main view set up as a Scroll View (to scroll the page when the user chooses enough days) and the top portion of the application is completed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have tried to set up the view as a UICollectionView but did not get very far as it did not appear to be right object type.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am currently working with an array of UIViews but the solution does not seem to be very optimized.  In the initial application load I am looping through 30 (max number of days for a trip) and creating a view (no sub objects yet) for each day.  I place the view based on calculations of the array index.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I do not add the subview to the main view if the array index is greater than the number of days for travel.

<p>There is a third way besides long ugly strings or huge methods chained together.

<p>Are you sure doInBackground isn't getting called? There are plenty of other ways which could cause theEntries to be null. For instance, an exception here: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>        Entry entries = mDBApi.metadata("/", 20000, null, true, null);&#xA;        for (Entry e : entries.contents)&#xA;        {&#xA;            Log.i("Hm", e.fileName());&#xA;            if (!e.isDeleted)&#xA;            {&#xA;                if(!e.isDir)&#xA;                {&#xA;                    theFiles.add(e);&#xA;                }&#xA;            }&#xA;        }&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>could cause theEntries to be null. Also, I think you could do this a better way. Instead of setting theEntries within doInBackground (which is in a different thread than your object was created in) you should instead have that function return the entries which will pass them to onPostExecute.I believe the code would look like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>protected class FilesLister extends AsyncTask&lt;String, Integer, Entry[]&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;    @Override&#xA;    protected Entry[] doInBackground(String... params)&#xA;    {&#xA;        Log.i("Entries", "We believe Entries has some values now.");&#xA;        Entry[] entriesReturn = null;&#xA;        ArrayList&lt;Entry&gt; theFiles = new ArrayList&lt;Entry&gt;();&#xA;        try&#xA;        {&#xA;            Entry entries = mDBApi.metadata("/", 20000, null, true, null);&#xA;            for (Entry e : entries.contents)&#xA;            {&#xA;                Log.i("Hm", e.fileName());&#xA;                if (!e.isDeleted)&#xA;                {&#xA;                    if(!e.isDir)&#xA;                    {&#xA;                        theFiles.add(e);&#xA;                    }&#xA;                }&#xA;            }&#xA;            entriesReturn = theFiles.toArray(new Entry[theFiles.size()]);&#xA;        } catch (DropboxException e1)&#xA;        {&#xA;            // TODO Auto-generated catch block&#xA;            e1.printStackTrace();&#xA;        }&#xA;        return entriesReturn;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    protected void onPostExecute(Entry[] result)&#xA;    {&#xA;        super.onPostExecute(result);&#xA;        Log.i("Now", "Calling refresh.");&#xA;        refresh(result);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then in your refresh method do the assignment..

<p>In fact I would go right in between the two suggested answers so far.

it creates the div class slider and within it my loading animation but after that it does not load the slide-items until after it executes the aslider function
i have reproduced what i want to happen in the console manually and it works fine increment the currentpage check
remove the .slider div check
execute flickr check
execute aslider check
initialize advslider check
everything works perfectly with all the second page images showing up
something is wrong with the sequence and i simply do not know what it is
i have tried everything i can find to get the aslider to wait but it doesn t work
please help
thanks

<p>Using Rhino Mocks, you could set an expectation for the property.  This basically states that you expect the property to be set to a certain value.  Using your example, an example test method body would be this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>&#xA;    var mock = MockRepository.GenerateMock();&#xA;    mock.Expect(x => x.Property1 = "Test");</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>var classUnderTest = new ClassUnderTest(mock);&#xA;classUnderTest.MethodUnderTest();&#xA;&#xA;mock.VerifyAllExpectations();&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This would check to see if <code>Property1</code> had been set to "Test" at some point between the call to <code>mock.Expect</code> and the call to <code>mock.MethodUnderTest</code> (technically, <code>Property1</code> could be set in the constructor of <code>ClassUnderTest</code>).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In order to test that the property was set and ignore what it was actually set to, just chain <code>IgnoreArguments</code> to the return of the <code>Expect</code> call, like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>&#xA;    mock.Expect(x => x.Property1 = "Test1").IgnoreArguments();</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One way to test more complex write-only properties is to use the <code>GetArgumentsForCallsMadeOn</code> method.  This allows you to retrieve a list of the arguments passed to each "call" of the property.  The code to do this would be like the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>&#xA;    var mock = MockRepository.GenerateMock();</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>var classUnderTest = new ClassUnderTest(mock);&#xA;classUnderTest.MethodUnderTest();&#xA;&#xA;//the argument in the Action is ignored, so just use null&#xA;//Property1 is of type List&lt;string&gt;&#xA;var arguments = mock.GetArgumentsForCallsMadeOn(x =&gt; x.Property1 = null);&#xA;&#xA;//arguments[0] contains the list of arguments for the first "call" of the&#xA;//property the first index (0) of that would contain the first argument&#xA;var firstCallArguments = arguments[0];&#xA;var firstArgument = (List&lt;string&gt;)firstCallArguments[0];&#xA;Assert.AreEqual(3, firstArgument.Count);&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am sure that Moq has similar functionality if you'd like to use that, instead.</p>&#xA;

<p>A little late to the game on this one, but I just worked out a solution to this so I thought I would share. In order to display the UI elements they have to be created on the UI thread on which they will be displayed. Since the long running task is on the UI thread, it will prevent a progress bar from updating. To get around this, I created the progress bar on a new UI thread and created the pages on the main UI thread.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>        Thread t = new Thread(() =&gt;&#xA;            {&#xA;                ProgressDialog pd = new ProgressDialog(context);&#xA;                pd.WindowStartupLocation = System.Windows.WindowStartupLocation.CenterScreen;&#xA;                pd.Show();&#xA;                System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.Run();&#xA;            });&#xA;        t.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);&#xA;        t.IsBackground = true;&#xA;        t.Start();&#xA;&#xA;        Action();   //we need to execute the action on the main thread so that UI elements created by the action can later be displayed in the main UI&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>'ProgressDialog' was my own WPF window for displaying progress information.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>'context' holds the progress data for my progress dialog. It includes a cancelled property so that I can abort the action running on the main thread. It also includes a complete property so the progress dialog can close when the Action has finished.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>'Action' is the method used to create all the UI elements. It monitors the context for the cancel flag and stops generating the UI elements if the flag is set.

<p>It is possible to refrase the description of needed regex to "contains at least one number" so the followind would work <code>/.*[\pN].*/</code>. Or, if you would like to limit your search to letters numbers and punctuation you shoud use <code>/[\pL\pN\pP]*[\pN][\pL\pN\pP]*/</code>. I've tested it on your examples and it works fine.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You can further refine your regexp by using lazy quantifiers like this <code>/.*?[\pN].*?/</code>.

i know that the standard does not define the behavior when a pure virtual function is called from a constructor or destructor also this is not a practical example of how i would write code in production it is just a test to check what the compiler does
testing the same construct in java prints
dosomething 0
that makes sense since param is not initialized at the point dosomething is called from the parent constructor
i would expect similar behavior in c++ with the difference that param contains anything at the time the function is called
instead compiling the above code results in a linker error with c++ ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5.1 4.4.3 saying that the reference to parent dosomething is undefined
so my question is why is this a linker error
if this is an error i would expect the compiler to complain especially because there is an implementation of the function

i also tried adding an attribute like in the allclientstest class
if there was a data driven way to set up the attribute i could load both sets of config in the base class and load the config there and eliminate the need of the superclasses which are basically solely being used to conveniently run a bunch of tests

i leave my original answer because i think it could be helpful anyway
from the ulimit manpage
-t the maximum amount of cpu time
in seconds
what counts in respect to ulimit is only cpu time
try to start your program like this
that will show you how much cpu time it really uses
my suspicion is that your endless loop contains sleep
and sleep time does not contribute to the cpu time of the process
this gets killed after one second
this seems to run forever but of course does not
measure cpu time like this.

<p>I think the easiest solution to this problem would be to add a transparent view that matches parent of your ViewGroup.

<p>I am implementing a <code>BlueTooth</code> and <code>Wifi</code> Based chat program for <code>iPhone</code>. For connection purpose I am using <code>GameKit</code>. But because of some special requirements application I can't use the default <code>GKPeerPickerController</code>. So I instead I created a <code>GKSession</code> and <code>GKSessionDelegate</code> combo to detect the peers. After they find each other, they can chat.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I have tested the chat functionality on three <code>mac-minis</code> using <code>simulator</code>, one simulator and one <code>iPod</code>, one <code>iPhone</code> and one <code>Simulator</code>. I am able to chat in all of the above scenarios. But some how the <code>iPhone</code> and <code>iPod</code> won't detect each other.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also I am curious about type of connection is happening between all these devices. Because theoretically <code>GameKit</code> supports both, <code>BlueTooth</code> and <code>WiFi</code>. Now the problem is that <code>GKPeerPickerController</code> let's one choose specifically between <code>BlueTooth</code> and <code>WiFi</code>, (unfortunately the implementation of <code>WiFi</code> is not documented anywhere.) This is fine, but what about the custom scenario when one implements his or her own <code>GKSession</code> and <code>GKSessionDelegate</code> Combo. When one creates <code>GKSession</code> Object using the only <code>init</code> method available: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>initWithSessionID:displayName:sessionMode:&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>only configuration option this provides is <code>sessionMode</code> but it has only three options </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>   GKSessionModeServer,&#xA;   GKSessionModeClient,&#xA;   GKSessionModePeer,&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>None of which indicates connection choice between <code>Bluetooth</code> and <code>WiFi</code>. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But I have disabled <code>bluetooth</code> on the <code>iPod</code> and tested it with a <code>mac-mini</code> it works so I guess this is using <code>WiFi</code>. Also in the log I get following line:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>DNSServiceRegister callback: Ref=4c3f3d0, Flags=2, ErrorType=0 name=00XGT0H0A..BTChat1 regtype=_0eilkgh5o2mq17._udp. domain=local.&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The <code>DNSServiceRegister</code> and <code>udp</code> part make me think the communication is happening over <code>TCP/IP</code>. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So does this mean that when I start with <code>GKSession</code> and <code>GKSessionDelegate</code> the default method of communication is WiFi only, or does it support <code>WiFi</code> and <code>bluetooth</code> both at the same time (though I never got a single indication that <code>BlueTooth</code> connection was happening). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But <code>GameKit</code> is supposed to be mainly about <code>BlueTooth</code> Right?

can anybody put light on the situation about what exactly is happening
also have you seen any sample code where somebody has implemented wifi interface for gkpeerpickercontroller
update
ok found it myself
gksession and gksessiondelegate custom implementations as i have mentioned in the question works for both bluetooth and wifi
actually the iphone jailbroked i am using had some issues with bluetooth and possibly that was preventing gamekit to work properly after hard resetting the phone and turning airplane mode on off bluetooth on off a few times got the bluetooth working on the phone
now the app is working fine in both wifi and bluetooth mode

<p>I use something like this: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>BEGIN { &#xA;    my $module_name    = shift; # @ARGV&#xA;    our $module_exp = $module_name;&#xA;    eval "use $module_name;";&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;$module_exp =~ s{::}{/}g;&#xA;foreach my $key ( grep { m/^$module_exp\./ } keys %INC ) { &#xA;    print "$key =&gt; $INC{$key}\n";&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But I use this more in the form of a korn shell function: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>function wherperl&#xA;{&#xA;     perl -M$1 &lt;&lt;EX_DOC&#xA;     my \$module = '$1';&#xA;     \$module =~ s/::/\\//g;&#xA;&#xA;     for ( keys %INC ) {&#xA;         next unless m/^\$module\./;&#xA;         print \$_ . ' =&gt; ' . \$INC{\$_} . "\n";&#xA;     }&#xA;EX_DOC&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>Is any differance between this two method?</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Yes.

<p>I am using phonegap version 2.2.0 and have installed ChildBrowser plugin code to XCode project, plugin loads fine with no problem. When navigating to a static html page in the main view which has bunch of <li> tags and each tag has link to external page. Once you click that external link the ChildBrowser loads as expected, but when I close the ChildBrowser by clicking "Done" button the original view is there as expected. but when you try to scroll in that main view the scrolling part quits working, I am no longer able to scroll that page? I added following <b>[[self parentViewController] reloadInputViews]</b> line and thought that may solve the issue, but the problem still remains. Also, it whacks out the original stlye meaning the buttons and font looks larger. Some how the original webview needs to maintain it correct state.

<p>So based on this line:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>Command="{Binding ElementName=MainGrid.DataContext ... }&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm assuming you have something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;Grid Name="MainGrid"&gt;&#xA;    &lt;Grid.DataContext&gt;&#xA;        &lt;lol:GridViewModel /&gt; &lt;!--Some kind of view model of sorts--&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/Grid.DataContext&gt;&#xA;    ... content&#xA;&lt;/Grid&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then all you would have to do is on the ViewModel class create a public property that returns some sort of <code>ICommand</code>, such as:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>class GridViewModel {&#xA;    public ICommand SelectionEditorSelectionSelectedCommand { &#xA;        get { return new TestCommand(); } &#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where <code>TestCommand</code> would be some kind of class implementing <code>ICommand</code> as in:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>class TestCommand : ICommand {&#xA;    public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged { get; set; }&#xA;&#xA;    public bool CanExecute(object parameter)&#xA;    {&#xA;        return true; // Expresses whether the command is operable or disabled.&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public void Execute(object parameter)&#xA;    {&#xA;         // The code to execute here when the command fires.&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically, for <code>ICommand</code> you just need to define what happens when the command <code>Executes</code>, how to determine whether or not it <code>CanExecute</code> and then supply an event handle for when <code>CanExecuteChanged</code>. Once you have this setup, all you have to do is wire up your button like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;Button Command="{Binding SelectionEditorSelectionSelectedCommand}" /&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And that's it. Basically the binding will automatically check your ViewModel class for a property called <code>SelectionEditorSelectionSelectedCommand</code>, that implements <code>ICommand</code>. When it reads the property it will instantiate an instance of <code>TestCommand</code>, and WPF will handle it from there. When the button is clicked <code>Execute</code> will be fired like clockwork.</p>&#xA;

 so based on this line: . ;. ;  . ;. ; i'm assuming you have something like this: . ;. ;  . ;. ; then all you would have to do is on the viewmodel class create a public property that returns some sort of  icommand , such as: . ;. ;  . ;. ; where  testcommand  would be some kind of class implementing  icommand  as in: . ;. ;  . ;. ; basically, for  icommand  you just need to define what happens when the command  executes , how to determine whether or not it  canexecute  and then supply an event handle for when  canexecutechanged . once you have this setup, all you have to do is wire up your button like this: . ;. ;  . ;. ; and that's it. basically the binding will automatically check your viewmodel class for a property called  selectioneditorselectionselectedcommand , that implements  icommand . when it reads the property it will instantiate an instance of  testcommand , and wpf will handle it from there. when the button is clicked  execute  will be fired like clockwork. . ;

<p>Case one, I don't really know why you have a delay the first time.

Long story short, the UI thread executes an infinite loop that alternates between refreshing the UI (that is, drawing what should be on screen, depending on the value of the controls), and executing whatever callback you queued with the dispatcher</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>From there, it's easy to understand what happens:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>In case two, your <code>Thread.Sleep</code> is executed by the UI thread.

Of course, the best way is to use animation. If you really don't want to, at least use a <code>TranslateTransform</code> to move your control instead of changing the margin. Using a <code>TranslateTransform</code> (assigned to the <code>RenderTransform</code> property of your control) only changes the visual appearance of the control (not the actual position), and therefore is fast. Changing the margin forces WPF to recompute part of the layout, which is CPU hungry.</p>&#xA;

case one i don t really know why you have a delay the first time
i guess it s doing some kind of initialization otherwise you d have the delay every time you press the button but i m not sure what precisely
for case two and three you must understand two things
whatever is inside your dispatcher.invoke gets executed by the ui thread
the ui isn t refreshed while a dispatcher callback is running
long story short the ui thread executes an infinite loop that alternates between refreshing the ui that is drawing what should be on screen depending on the value of the controls and executing whatever callback you queued with the dispatcher
from there it s easy to understand what happens
in case two your thread.sleep is executed by the ui thread
while it s sleeping it can t refresh the ui
in case three you never exit the dispatcher leaving no chance for the ui thread to redraw the screen
as to know how to fix it.
of course the best way is to use animation
if you really don t want to at least use a translatetransform to move your control instead of changing the margin

<p>Inheritance in embedded entities hardly makes sense, because it calls for a different set of columns in the containing entity table depending on the actual class of the embedded entity, but at the time of declaration, the ORM does not know anything about the classes that may be derived from the base class that you want to make embedded.  I hear that EclipseLink somehow does it, (I don't want to even think of what kind of evil deeds they do to pull that trick,) but as far as I know, hibernate does not support it.</p>&#xA;

first strictly speaking none of the tools quoted here so far are cvs clients
they re all just gui frontends on top of the cvsnt commandline client iirc only smartcvs uses a plain cvs client
so i d be interested to hear what particular operations you think are slow in wincvs
the real bottleneck is usually the cvs protocol itself and that will behave the same regardless of which gui frontend you use
also what exactly do you mean by has no merge dialog
wincvs integrates nicely with winmerge also as conflict editor
and if you were talking about executing merge operations you use the update command which has a merge options tab.
for previewing updates there are also several approaches in wincvs if you just want to see which files would get updated you can use the query update command cvs -n up or if you want the details you can simply diff using winmerge against head also works on multiple files and folders
i ve had both tortoise and wincvs installed for years but usually find that i do not use tortoise except when i feel guilty about not getting what all the fuss is about.

it s all a matter of taste i guess especially whether you prefer an integrated solution that tries not to get in the way over a standalone app that forces you to make conscious decisions about your version control tasks
wincvs for me does all i want and more but then i m probably considered a power user and a heavily biased one at that as i used to be a cvsgui mailing list moderator and faq author and also wrote many of the stock macros
then again there hasn t really been any active development on wincvs for quuuuiiiite some time.




<p>I'm having a problem with my time scale line graph in "real time", which is going out of graph container: See full code in action also here: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/matjazzeleznik/h482j06d/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>What I want to achieve:</strong> Currently I have static/dummy data for <code>temp</code> and <code>time</code> which will be later populated via AJAX / JSON.

from a c11 draft
3.4.3 undefined behavior
behavior upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data for which this international standard imposes no requirements
note possible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable results to behaving during translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic of the
environment with or without the issuance of a diagnostic message to terminating a translation or execution with the issuance of a diagnostic message
terminating the translation is mentioned as a possible consequence of undefined behavior in the non-normative note so compile-time effects are clearly not intended to be excluded
the normative part certainly allows it - it allows anything
so conforming compiler can terminate the translation if it detects undefined behavior during compilation
additionally in 4 conformance
if a shall or shall not requirement that appears outside of a constraint or runtime-constraint is violated the behavior is undefined
undefined behavior is otherwise indicated in this international standard by the words undefined behavior or by the omission of any explicit definition of behavior
there is no difference in emphasis among these three
they all describe behavior that is undefined
there is no distinction made either in the normative definition or in the conformance description between translation time and execution time
no difference is made between different varieties of undefined behavior
additionally defect report #109 pointed out by ouah in can code that will never be executed invoke undefined behavior
has this in its response
... if an expression whose evaluation would result in undefined behavior appears in a context where a constant expression is required the containing program is not strictly conforming
furthermore if every possible execution of a given program would result in undefined behavior the given program is not strictly conforming
a conforming implementation must not fail to translate a strictly conforming program simply because some possible execution of that program would result in undefined behavior
...
this would indicate that a compiler cannot fail a translation if it cannot statically determine that all paths lead to undefined behavior

so i tried kanso
it gave me some trouble that implied immaturity - however it demonstrateds a great potential
mostly compatibiliy view with npm with node 0.6.x and some open edge-cases
so i looked a little deeper
i saw it comes with a templates engine of it s own
but what if i want to reuse templates that are written already by another standard
for example - haml or even better - jade that has also a nice text-to-text js implementation and a well growing jquery plugin - same link - see end of document
does anybody here know how coupled the templates engine with the kanso types mechanism and how simple should it be to use other template engines instead

<p>Given that your <code>dates</code> and <code>values</code> properties are mutable lists, you could just read a row at a time (ungrouped), and key a dictionary keyed by name, adding dates and values as you go:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>var readings = new Dictionary&lt;string, MeterReadingsChartData&gt;();&#xA;while (reader.Read())&#xA;{&#xA;     string name = reader.GetString(0);&#xA;     DateTime date = reader.GetDateTime(1);&#xA;     double value = reader.GetDouble(2);&#xA;&#xA;     MeterReadingsChartData group;&#xA;     if (!readings.TryGetValue(name, out group))&#xA;     {&#xA;         group = new MeterReadingsChartData {&#xA;             Name = name, &#xA;             Values = new List&lt;double&gt;(),&#xA;             Dates = new List&lt;DateTime&gt;()&#xA;         };&#xA;         readings[name] = group;    &#xA;     }&#xA;     group.Values.Add(value);&#xA;     group.Dates.Add(date);&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A few notes:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>I've PascalCased your property names to follow .NET naming conventions</li>&#xA;<li>In your LINQ code you've use <code>ToArray</code>, which wouldn't actually compile if your properties are really lists... if your properties are actually arrays, the approach above wouldn't work</li>&#xA;<li>Rather than have two separate lists, you may want to use a single <code>List&lt;Tuple&lt;DateTime, double&gt;&gt;</code> or even create a separate <code>Reading</code> class with just a date and a value.</li>&#xA;<li>You could give your DTO a constructor accepting the name, initialize the list in the constructor, make the list properties read-only, and also create an <code>AddReading(DateTime, double)</code> method to make the calling code cleaner.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;

a few notes
i ve pascalcased your property names to follow .net naming conventions
in your linq code you ve use toarray which wouldn t actually compile if your properties are really lists.
if your properties are actually arrays the approach above wouldn t work
rather than have two separate lists you may want to use a single or even create a separate reading class with just a date and a value
you could give your dto a constructor accepting the name initialize the list in the constructor make the list properties read-only and also create an addreading datetime double method to make the calling code cleaner

<p>So if i got it right, you want to fill the FormData object. Because currently it's blank.&#xA;You can use append method:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>    var formData = new FormData();&#xA;    var $myField = $('#myField');&#xA;    formData.append('myField', $myField.val());&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To append file:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>    var $fileField = $('#fileField');&#xA;    var myFile = $fileField.get(0).files[0];&#xA;    formData.append('myFile', myFile);&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To append multiplie files you should set the name properly:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>    formData.append('myFile[]', myFileFirst);&#xA;    formData.append('myFile[]', myFileSecond);&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Check it here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12989442/uploading-multiple-files-using-formdata">Uploading multiple files using formData()</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, you can grab the whole form data through constructor:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>    var form = $('form').get(0);&#xA;    var formData = new FormData(form);&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

 so if i got it right, you want to fill the formdata object. because currently it's blank.. ;you can use append method: . ;. ;  . ;. ; to append file: . ;. ;  . ;. ; to append multiplie files you should set the name properly: . ;. ;  . ;. ; check it here:  uploading multiple files using formdata()  . ;. ; also, you can grab the whole form data through constructor: . ;. ;  . ;

so if i got it right you want to fill the formdata object
because currently it s blank
you can use append method
to append file
to append multiplie files you should set the name properly
check it here uploading multiple files using formdata
also you can grab the whole form data through constructor

<p>Django (and relational data bases in general) do not work this way.

<p>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" rel="nofollow">addEventListener</a> to add events, do not set them as an attribute.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>href.addEventListener("click", function() { displayer(uid); });&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The reason why your code did not work is it is adding it as an attribute.

<p>First you need to instruct Apache to listen on the ports you need:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>Listen 80&#xA;Listen 8089&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Second you need to tell it what to do with 80 and 8089 traffic:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;&#xA;    DocumentRoot /website/site80&#xA;    ServerName internet.dev&#xA;&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;VirtualHost *:8089&gt;&#xA;    DocumentRoot /website/site8089&#xA;&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Third you need to "allow" Apache to use those directories:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;Directory "C:/website/site80"&gt;&#xA;    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI&#xA;    AllowOverride All&#xA;    Order allow,deny&#xA;    Allow from all&#xA;&lt;/Directory&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;Directory "C:/website/site8089"&gt;&#xA;    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI&#xA;    AllowOverride All&#xA;    Order allow,deny&#xA;    Allow from all&#xA;&lt;/Directory&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

 first you need to instruct apache to listen on the ports you need: . ;. ;  . ;. ; second you need to tell it what to do with 80 and 8089 traffic: . ;. ;  . ;. ; third you need to "allow" apache to use those directories: . ;. ;  . ;

<p>Start by changing the constructor of the <code>MMCode</code> so it doesn't need the guess...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>public MMCode(){&#xA;    setSecret();&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Add a new method called <code>setGuess</code>, for example...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>public void setGuess(String[] guessess){&#xA;    for (int i = 0; i &lt; guess.length; i++) {&#xA;        this.guess[i] = guessess[i];&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Take <code>MMCode MM = new MMCode(guess);</code> from the <code>actionPeformed</code> method and make it a instance variable</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>public class GUIMasterMind implements ActionListener {&#xA;    //...&#xA;    private MMCode mmCode;&#xA;    //...&#xA;    public GUIMasterMind() {&#xA;        //...&#xA;        mmCode = new MMCode();&#xA;        //...&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then in <code>actionPerformed</code> method, you simply need to update the instance of <code>MMCode</code>...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event){&#xA;    //...&#xA;    else if(eventName.equals("Compare")){&#xA;        String[] guess = new String[4];&#xA;&#xA;        for (int i = 0; i &lt; guess.length; i++) {&#xA;            guess[i] = g1.substring(i, i+1);&#xA;            System.out.println(guess[i]);&#xA;        }&#xA;&#xA;        mmCode.setGuess(guess);&#xA;        //...&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

looking for some expert advice here about how best to style the following html
to obtain a result that behaves like this
the criteria that i am working with are the following
the container div .parent is a block element and fills the entire width of the browser window
i know the width of the first left inner div in pixels but not as a percentage based on the regularity of the images that will go there
i don t know the width of the second right inner div - as it contains a variable amount of text that should automatically fill the entire space to the right regardless of browser window width
the height of the first left div when shorter than the second right div should stretch to the same height here s the reason the first left div will have a right-border to set it off from the second right div and this border should be the height of the .parent div
however the first left div is not always present in the mark-up in which case the border should not appear
i cannot use javascript trickery
solutions i have tried based on my experience and help from web sources
float
the traditional method that uses float left leaves me apparently unable to stretch the first left div to the variable height of either its sibling or .parent
inline-block
.parent background-color #999999

.parent .child display inline-block
vertical-align top
height 100

using display inline-block appears to work like a charm when the text in the second right div is not enough to fill an entire line
the moment there is more text however the second right div grows as wide as the outer container will let it forcing it to wrap under the first right div
any insights would be much appreciated

<p>I would also suggest, like Tudor, to use only one agent. But then I would use inheritance, declaring a base_driver and a base_sequencer (that may have common functionalities from both ModeA or ModeB drivers and/or sequencers), and ModeA and ModeB units would extend those base ones. Then, in the agent, and using a flag in the uvm_config_db set in each test, you would select between instantiating one or the other:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Base driver:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>class my_proj_base_driver extends uvm_driver#(my_proj_tr);&#xA;[...]&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>ModeA driver:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>class my_proj_ModeA_driver extends my_proj_base_driver;&#xA;[...]&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>ModeB driver:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>class my_proj_ModeB_driver extends my_proj_base_driver;&#xA;[...]&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the agent:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>[...]&#xA;&#xA;my_proj_base_driver driver;&#xA;bit modeAorB // 0 for A, 1 for B&#xA;&#xA;[...]&#xA;&#xA;if (!uvm_config_db#(bit)::get(this,"","modeAorB", modeAorB))&#xA;  `uvm_fatal("NOMODE","No mode set for this agent")&#xA;&#xA;if(!modeAorB)&#xA;  driver = my_proj_ModeA_driver::type_id::create(.name("driver"), .parent(this));&#xA;else&#xA;  driver = my_proj_ModeB_driver::type_id::create(.name("driver"), .parent(this));&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And the same for the sequencer.</p>&#xA;

<p>I have a model for which i'll have one single instance, so i need to override the changelist_view to by-pass it (only if i have at least one record saved), and jump directly to change_view. i found snippet online and it works well for it, so i wrote my custom changelist_view:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>def changelist_view(self, request, extra_context=None):&#xA;    queryset = self.model.objects.all()&#xA;    if queryset.count()&gt;0:&#xA;        try:&#xA;            obj = queryset[0]&#xA;            return self.change_view(request, str(obj.id), extra_context)&#xA;        except IndexError:&#xA;            pass&#xA;    return super(MyModelAdmin, self).changelist_view(request, extra_context)&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>this works until I try to save.

<p>I'm building a web app using AngularJS. The app needs to poll a URL that returns JSON data and make that data available to any part of the app. From what I've read so far, my best bet is to create a service that handles the polling and keeps its own internal cache of the JSON data, and then inject the service into any part of the app that wants to consult that data. What I'm lost on is how to actually go about doing that. The closest example I've found is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13937318/convert-angular-http-get-function-to-a-service">this question</a>, but it appears to be creating a service that's manually called by a specific controller (which is itself tied to a given route), whereas I want something that persistently runs in the background of the app forever regardless of what part of the app is active. Is this doable, or am I taking the completely wrong approach?</p>&#xA;

<p>I think you're conflating security and permissions with Django's authentication system. For the most part, Django's tools are mainly designed for separating users into two groups: authenticated (logged in), and anonymous. This makes sense for 90% of the web sites out there, as you don't really need too much differentiation (maybe another for a hidden admin, but that's an edge case, rather than the norm).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The permission_required decorator is a very simple hook for people wishing to redirect people who failed to have permissions to go to the login page. At some point, though, this is not enough. If you need a specific permission and the user does not have it, how does redirecting them to the login page help them?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In this case, it's so easy to roll your own decorator using the messages for specific errors.

<p>I have an Incident class that uses the HasMany attribute to a Location class. All works using the static Find methods. But I need to add a where clause to the Location table.

<p><code>HashSet</code> doesn't allow duplicated based on <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code> methods, but arrays don't override such methods, so even if you have two arrays with the same content, they <strong>are not</strong> the <em>same</em> arrays, so they will be allowed in a <code>Set</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Use <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> instead.

<p>There are a lot of things wrong here, you should read some good basic docs about SignalR concepts first. The guide you are referring to is very poor.

You already know about <code>IHubContext</code>, so use that from outside hubs, and you should use hubs just for what they are for, without keeping them alive artificially when attaching them to dependency event or, even worse, creating them explicitly.

the guide you are referring to is very poor
the main things you should check
hubs are created by signalr from scratch each time a hub method is called from a client and then destroyed therefore for something as basic as this you should not interfere with that which instead you do with your event handler
because of the previous point your userid member is simply not in the right place and it sort of works for you just because of wrong side effects you are generating with more mistakes described below do not store any state supposed to live across calls inside hubs instance members it is not meant to survive
you explicitly do a new notificationhub for something that has nothing to do with signalr broadcasting you should move the sql dependency stuff outside of the hub and do it there while leaving hubs do their own stuff only
when you change page your connection is lost buy your event handler is probably artificially keeping a dead hub instance alive and it uses it for notification but that s simply wrong
you should review your design starting by managing the sql dependency outside of hubs
you already know about ihubcontext so use that from outside hubs and you should use hubs just for what they are for without keeping them alive artificially when attaching them to dependency event or even worse creating them explicitly
you re on the road to entangled spaghetti code which is hard to reason about and understand as you are clearly experiencing

<p>In my application there is a form which has more than 50 fields. I have to send the filled form details to http server. I'm saving the form filled on submit button to my local db. A form can be filled multiple times. When the device is connected to network I have to send all the data to server. Each row I have parsed it to json object. My question is how to send these json objects? I can't use Volley, as I have to send json string not object.&#xA;Thanks.</p>&#xA;

<p>I have a web server returning an thrift object serialized used the JSON protocol to a client html page using the pure Javascript Thrift library (<a href="https://github.com/apache/thrift/tree/master/lib/js/src" rel="nofollow"><code>thrift.js</code></a>). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The server for example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>from MyThriftFile.ttypes import ThriftClass&#xA;from thrift import TSerialization&#xA;from thrift.protocol import TJSONProtocol&#xA;&#xA;thrift_obj = new ThriftClass()&#xA;result = TSerialization.serialize(&#xA;    thrift_obj,&#xA;    protocol_factory=TJSONProtocol.TJSONProtocolFactory())&#xA;&#xA;return result&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now in the C#, Python, Java, and even the node.js Thrift libraries there is some form of this generic TSerialization or TDeserialization utlity and its more or less implemented like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>def deserialize(base,&#xA;        buf,&#xA;        protocol_factory=TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocolFactory()):&#xA;&#xA;    transport = TTransport.TMemoryBuffer(buf)&#xA;    protocol = protocol_factory.getProtocol(transport)&#xA;    base.read(protocol)&#xA;    return base&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So it gets it data, loads it up into a throw away transport (because we are not going to send this information anywhere), creates a new protocol object for encoding this data, and finally the actual thrift object reads this data to populate itself.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The pure javacript library however seems to lack this functionality.

<p>Actually it is:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>The i loop iterates O(N) times, so the value of i is O(N), so we can say O(I)=O(N).</li>&#xA;<li>The j loop iterates O(I^2) = O(N^2) times (when considered on its own, without the outer loop).</li>&#xA;<li>The k loop iterates O(I*J) = O(N*N^2) = O(N^3) times.</li>&#xA;<li>The l loop just iterates 10 times so that is O(1).</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The loops are nested so we have to multiply these together (do you understand why?).

<p>I would like to implement drag-n-drop feature for Android 2.2. I override onTouchListener for each my control. But all my controls are inside ScrollView.

<p>In PowerShell, the <code>Get-ChildItem</code> cmdlet works like <code>ls</code> (at least with the file system provider).

<p>I also encountered this issue, the fix is to upgrade your <code>sympy</code> version. I found that 0.7.6 reproduces the error, but 0.7.7 has it fixed.

<p>Start by simplifying your query as you do not need to do multiple <code>DISTINCT</code>s (it's only necessary in the final output) and you are selecting many columns that you are not outputting. You are also joining some tables which you are not selecting from and if there are multiple matching rows for these then it may generate duplicate rows - using something like <code>EXISTS</code> can eliminate these joins.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>WITH MARC_SEL AS (&#xA;  SELECT A.SOURCE,&#xA;         MARA.MATNR,&#xA;         MARC.WERKS&#xA;  FROM   XXX_MAIN.XXX_XSAP A&#xA;         INNER JOIN XXX_MAIN.XXX_SAP_MARA MARA&#xA;         ON (    A.MATNR = MARA.MATNR &#xA;             AND A.MTART = MARA.MTART )&#xA;         INNER JOIN XXX_MAIN.XXX_SAP_MARC MARC&#xA;         ON (    MARA.MATNR = MARC.MATNR )&#xA;  WHERE  EXISTS( SELECT 'X'&#xA;                 FROM   XXX_MAIN.XXX_MP_WERKS_PLANT_XREF PX&#xA;                 WHERE  PX.LEGACY_PLANT = MARC.WERKS&#xA;                 AND    PX.SOURCE = 'SP' )&#xA;  AND    EXISTS( SELECT 'X'&#xA;                 FROM   XXX_MAIN.XXX_SAP_MBEW MBEW&#xA;                 WHERE  MARC.MATNR = MBEW.MATNR&#xA;                 AND    MARC.WERKS = MBEW.BWKEY )&#xA;  AND    A.SOURCE  = 'SP'&#xA;)&#xA;, MVKE_SEL AS (&#xA;  SELECT  NVL(MX_VKORG.SAP_DE_VAL,'/') VKORG,&#xA;          NVL(SUBSTR(MX_VKORG.SAP_DE,6,2),'/') VTWEG,&#xA;          MX_VKORG.DESC4 &#xA;  FROM    XXX_MAIN.XXX_MP_VKVT_XREF MX_VKORG&#xA;  WHERE   EXISTS ( SELECT 'X'&#xA;                   FROM   XXX_MAIN.XXX_SAP_MVKE MVKE&#xA;                   WHERE  MX_VKORG.SOURCE_DE_VAL = MVKE.VKORG&#xA;                   AND    SUBSTR(MX_VKORG.SAP_DE,6,2) = MVKE.VTWEG )&#xA;  AND     MX_VKORG.SOURCE_TBL = 'SP'&#xA;  AND     MX_VKORG.SOURCE_DE = 'MVKE'&#xA;  AND     SUBSTR(MX_VKORG.SAP_DE,1,5)= 'VKORG'&#xA;  AND     MX_VKORG.DESC2 IS NULL&#xA;)&#xA;SELECT DISTINCT&#xA;       MARC.SOURCE,&#xA;       MARC.MATNR,&#xA;       MVKE.VKORG,&#xA;       MARC.WERKS,&#xA;       MVKE.VTWEG  &#xA;FROM   MARC_SEL MARC&#xA;       INNER JOIN MVKE_SEL MVKE&#xA;       ON (    MARC.MATNR = MVKE.MATNR   &#xA;           AND MARC.WERKS = MVKE.DESC4 )&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

<p>I am trying to implement a Codeigniter based app on Android via phonegap, all works well apart from logging in/out with tank auth. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When the login form is submitted it keeps showing a dialog saying 'Complete action using' with an option to select a browser, rather than staying in the app window. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If you select a browser it opens a browser window with the login page again, but if the app is re-started it is logged in.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can I stop this jump to the browser so the app is seamless? I think it is when tank auth is writing/destroying the cookie info. This is running in an /android subfolder off the root as the client host does not support subdomains.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is the tank auth login code.

i am trying to implement a codeigniter based app on android via phonegap all works well apart from logging in out with tank auth
when the login form is submitted it keeps showing a dialog saying complete action using with an option to select a browser rather than staying in the app window
if you select a browser it opens a browser window with the login page again but if the app is re-started it is logged in
how can i stop this jump to the browser so the app is seamless
i think it is when tank auth is writing destroying the cookie info
this is running in an android subfolder off the root as the client host does not support subdomains
this is the tank auth login code
note that home is the default controller

<p>I would suggest doing something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1) Assuming this is something you are developing yourself, make sure your data structure is all in order first.

The first would go like this, saved as <code>ViewingCounts</code>...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>SELECT Properties.PropertyID, Count(Viewings.PropertyID) As ViewingCount&#xA;FROM Properties LEFT JOIN Viewings ON Properties.PropertyID = Viewings.PropertyID&#xA;GROUP BY Properties.PropertyID;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>... and the second like this, saved as <code>ViewingCountsForDisplay</code>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>SELECT Properties.*, IIf(ViewingCount = 0, 'No viewings', ViewingCount) AS Viewings&#xA;FROM Properties INNER JOIN ViewingCounts ON Properties.PropertyID = ViewingCounts.PropertyID&#xA;ORDER BY Properties.PropertyID;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

<p>I'm trying to deal with the issue of scope inside of an ng-repeat loop - I've browsed quite a few questions but have not quite been able to get my code to work. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Controller code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>function Ctrl($scope) {&#xA;  $scope.lines = [{text: 'res1'}, {text:'res2'}];&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>View:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;div ng-app&gt;&#xA;     &lt;div ng-controller="Ctrl"&gt;&#xA;       &lt;div ng-repeat="line in lines"&gt;&#xA;           &lt;div class="preview"&gt;{{text}}{{$index}}&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;       &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;       &lt;div ng-repeat="line in lines"&gt;&#xA;           &lt;-- typing here should auto update it's preview above --&gt;&#xA;           &lt;input value="{{line.text}}" ng-model="text{{$index}}"/&gt;&#xA;            &lt;!-- many other fields here that will also affect the preview --&gt;&#xA;       &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;     &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's a fiddle: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/cyberwombat/zqTah/">http://jsfiddle.net/cyberwombat/zqTah/</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically I have an object (it's a flyer generator) which contains multiple lines of text.

<p>I just started to play around with EntityFramework. In VS2012 I can use the designer which nicely creates all the boilerplate code. However, I am now at a point where I wanted to start playing with overriding DbContext.Seed() to initialize the database with some data. While there is this quite easily done writing the DbContext myself, I was not able to find a way to do this from within the designer. It seems to be no option to modify the Designer created 'Context' class. The comment at the top of the file tells me, that all manually added code will be lost when the file is regenerated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Am I missing something? Can someone please point me in the right direction. How can I do all the nice more advanced things and still continue to use the designer.</p>&#xA;

<p>JavaScript is my favorite programming language in the world, but it's probably one of the <strong>worst</strong> programming languages to start learning with.  There are hidden nuances around every corner.  For example functions can be called in <em>four</em> different ways (the last two are grouped together), each of which affects what <code>this</code> will be equal to</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code> foo();                     //this = global object or undefined in strict mode&#xA; obj.foo();                 //this = obj&#xA; new Foo();                 //this = object inheriting from Foo's prototype&#xA; foo.call(lala, 12, 3);&#xA; foo.apply(lala, [12, 3]); ?/this = lala?#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then there's the fact that, though it doesn't support classes, it really wants developers to think that it does:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>var p = new Person(); //Person's a class, right?&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And when it comes time to create objects, you have oh so many options to choose from:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>function Person(name){&#xA;    this.name = name;&#xA;}&#xA;var p = new Person("Adam");&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>var p = { name: "Adam" };&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>function createPerson(name){&#xA;    var that = {};&#xA;    that.name = name;&#xA;    return that;&#xA;}&#xA;var p = createPerson("Adam");&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And of course inheritance will be completely different depending on which of the above you choose. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Combine all that with function scope, no compiler to point out obvious errors, semicolon-insertion to <strong>create</strong> errors for you, and I'd strongly suggest you start with a more traditional language like C# or Java.</p>&#xA;

<p>If your xml elements are in a namespace, even if it is the default namespace for the document, you must use namespace prefixes in any XPath expressions and template match rules. It is the namespace uri and not the prefix that matters.

but when i call it in side the out the side the block its not trigerring
how can i do this
my scripts inside the still its not get change i need to process dvalue in my siprifixx its need to humanize.but this thinks i do get values but the siprifixx not getting fired

Depending on how much else is used by the stack and such, you could be thrashing the cache. This could explain why reducing the block size improved performance: With smaller blocks, less memory was used in each iteration, and all of it fit in cache, so little or nothing was cast out during an iteration. Another way to deal with this sort of cache thrashing is strip mining: Instead of performing sve, svesq, vmul, vmma, and memcpy on the entire length, perform all of them on a portion of the length (e.g., half), then perform all of them on another portion, and repeat as necessary until they have been entirely processed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>trigarray5 only exists so that the second vmma negates trigarray4.

Cache is partitioned into sets, and each memory address must be mapped to a particular set.  E.g., a cache with 32,768 bytes may have 1024 lines?of 32 bytes each, but it may be organized into 256 sets of four lines. Any one memory address maps to one set, and it must use one of the four lines in that set. If you have five arrays that start at the same address modulo this geometry (or that substantially overlap), then they will contend for the four lines in each set, casting each other out as they go.

However, this is not always possible, as when a routine that operates on multiple vectors is passed vectors with different alignments.

first with 7 arrays of 4 kb each you are using nearly the size of l1 cache
depending on how much else is used by the stack and such you could be thrashing the cache
this could explain why reducing the block size improved performance with smaller blocks less memory was used in each iteration and all of it fit in cache so little or nothing was cast out during an iteration
another way to deal with this sort of cache thrashing is strip mining instead of performing sve svesq vmul vmma and memcpy on the entire length perform all of them on a portion of the length half then perform all of them on another portion and repeat as necessary until they have been entirely processed
trigarray5 only exists so that the second vmma negates trigarray4
eliminate trigarray5 and call vmmsb subtract instead of add with trigarray4
this also reduces memory use
cache geometry sometimes causes thrashing to occur even when less data than fills cache is used
cache is partitioned into sets and each memory address must be mapped to a particular set
e.g. a cache with 32 768 bytes may have 1024 lines of 32 bytes each but it may be organized into 256 sets of four lines
any one memory address maps to one set and it must use one of the four lines in that set

this is avoided when arrays are allocated consecutively in memory as the compiler commonly does when arrays are simply declared one after the other but there can be complications

aligning the arrays to multiples of 16 bytes is fine and may help slightly
in certain situations it helps a lot
when possible many vdsp routines do process a few initial elements to reach a well-aligned boundary and then uses fast simd code until near the end of the array when another few elements may need to be processed individually

the cost of the actual function call and return itself is likely trivial
the apple-supplied compilers do not better vectorize simple multiplication and addition than accelerate can and function calls are not quite expensive.
you omitted the strides
if they are not one you will likely gain a lot by rewriting your code so that the data has unit stride when the vdsp routines are called

in adapter add the next
then check like isme section
if isprivatemessageforme textview.settext its private message nobody can see it except you

use installeventfilter method to route all the lineedit events via easy-to-be-customized eventfilter method
now all the events self.line triggers are going to go through eventfilter
there using received event object we query postion using
which we send to leftclicked methods as an argument the same method is called on lineeidit s right-click
from pyqt4.qtcore import

solution # 2
first connect qlineedit s easiest-to-trigger cursorpositionchanged signal to a method
when on a left-click this method is called query the current mouse cursor position with qt s qcursor.pos
which returns something like
finally move the menu to a queried mouse cursor position and show it

you discovered a compiler bug
the array is treated as an array of pointers and then things go wrong when foreach tries to iterate over that pointer array
btw it works if you compile for 32-bit because there
the compiler should not allow a value typed array to be passed to the generic function
this can be fixed by using instead of an array
this works because has it s own iterator implementation which seems to be safer in this case
it s not a perfect solution either some gee types have problems with value type parameters because they expect the type to be nullable
generics in vala are always a bit tricky you should not be passing value types into generics
if you use an int
nullable int which is a reference type it works as expected
nullable types aren t perfect either because they need more memory and they don t perform as good as value types but that s just the way it is
the code is still a bit problematic because you are casting the element to an int or int

<p>You must always follow the rule of "Least Privileged Access".  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Apart of this is taking into consideration what applications that are using the database.

<p>If I figure it right, your problem can be solved with multi instance tasks.  <a href="http://activiti.org/userguide/#bpmnMultiInstance" rel="nofollow">Read more about it.</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Main idea would be to declare task "plan anual de necesidades" as parallel multi-instance  (<code>isSequential="false"</code>), also declare your loop cardinality (number of waiting schools) and if you need, assign every parallel task to specific user or role. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For second problem you can also can use multi instance forking by role.

<p>You need to create an index on <code>uuid</code> column.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Without the index, for every entry in the batch the DB engine will have to go through all rows of the table to determine which row to update, giving you time complexity in the scale of <em>(number of rows updated)</em> * <em>(number of all rows in the table)</em>.

<p><strong>In the old approach, one can potentially load many scripts</strong>. The script loader (be that Yepnope or something else) tests features that you specify, and for each test, it selects a script to load.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As a simple example, let's say that you want to load your own script, plus a version of jQuery with support for IE&lt;9 if needed, or a newer jQuery if possible:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>yepnope({&#xA;    "test" : document.attachEvent,&#xA;    "yep" : 'jquery-1.11.3.js',&#xA;    "nope" : 'jquery-2.1.4.js'&#xA;});&#xA;yepnope({&#xA;    "load" : "myscript.js"&#xA;});&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>In the new approach, you only load one script: it might have several versions, but the browser only concerns itself with one of them</strong>. These different versions would to handle different combinations of browser features, but the browser (and user) only ever have to be concerned with one file. The script loader runs its tests, and based on the results, picks which build to download.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Doing this with the example above would require you to build <code>myscript.js</code> twice. One version would be concatenated with jQuery 2.x for modern browsers, and the other would be concatenated with jQuery 1.x for support in old browsers. You <em>could</em> make yepnope work in this situation, assuming you have some other way of creating the builds. It would look like something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>yepnope({&#xA;    "test" : document.attachEvent,&#xA;    "yep" : "myscript-oldie.js",&#xA;    "nope" : "myscript-modern.js"&#xA;});&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But that leaves open the question of what to use for build tools. Many other script loaders -require.js, Browserify, webpack, and so on- already come with their own tools for building scripts. Yepnope doesn't, and the folks behind it decided that other loaders were already building better scripts than they could.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Why do this? Network latency. <strong>Many scripts -perhaps most- are small enough that it takes more time to set up and tear down an HTTP request than it does to do the actual work of downloading the file</strong>.

<p>Without claiming it's pretty, I'd suggest the following.

'::configure')</code> also works (at least in php 5.3, which is where I tested it), but it relies on the odd (to me) scoping of $this.  I'm uncertain whether this is reliable or will carry forward into future versions.  The version above "should be" more robust, given my limited knowledge.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If keeping the outside call as configure() is a requirement, I'd suggest renaming all your "configure()" methods to "configure_local()" or some such, and rename "configure_master()" to "configure()".  In fact, that's what I'd do to start with, but that's a matter of personal taste.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If you need both the internal method and the external API to remain the same...  Then you're stuck, since the base class method is overridden, but I'm sure you knew that.</p>&#xA;

<p>Is there a way to write an SQL order by query to sort three columns(day,month,year) together not individually. This seems tricky because 2 12 2016 should come before 1 12 2017 if in ascending order. &#xA;How do I go about this?</p>&#xA;

<p>William Pursell's answer is much smarter, but in my straight-forward beginners mind I tried following some time ago:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>#!/bin/bash&#xA;&#xA;data="data.dat"&#xA;datalength=`wc $data | awk '{print $1;}'`&#xA;&#xA;for (( i=1; i&lt;=$datalength; i++ )) ;do&#xA;&#xA;x=`cat $data | awk '{print $1;}' | sed -n "$i"p | sed -e 's/[eE]+*/\\*10\\^/'` ; x=`echo "$x" | bc -l`       ; echo "x$i=$x";&#xA;y=`cat $data | awk '{print $2;}' | sed -n "$i"p | sed -e 's/[eE]+*/\\*10\\^/'` ; y=`echo "$y" | bc -l`       ; echo "y$i=$y";&#xA;z=`cat $data | awk '{print $3;}' | sed -n "$i"p | sed -e 's/[eE]+*/\\*10\\^/'` ; z=`echo "$z" | bc -l`       ; echo "z$i=$z";&#xA;&#xA;# do something with xyz:&#xA;&#xA;fslmaths ~/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm -mul 0 -add 1 -roi $x 1 $y 1 $z 1 0 1 point -odt float &gt; NewFile$i&#xA;&#xA;done&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The <code>bc</code> and the <code>sed -e 's/[eE]+*/\\*10\\^/'</code> have to be added if you like to use floating point numbers and for the case that input also uses exponential notation.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I had a similar problem but for lots of input data those bash scripts are very slow.

<p>The <code>expr</code> command is <em>defined</em> to convert its result to a number if it is legal to do so. It's been this way since?well, since at least Tcl <strong><em>7.0</em></strong> and probably since the first version of Tcl to have an <code>expr</code> command (which takes it a hugely long way back). This means that if you return a valid octal number (which <code>09</code> isn't), <code>expr</code> <em>will</em> convert it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If this behaviour isn't desired, don't use <code>expr</code> for conditionals; use <code>if</code>.

<p>I'm trying to implement the Jersey framework in order to route our client requests using the restful approach. I have successfully created methods that read primitive parameters, send them and they can even respond with a JSON from an object. However the one thing I have not been able to do is read (i.e. consume) a json object from a post/put or even get request. I've tried everything I can find online but to no avail. Because of some work issues I am confined using Java 6 and Jersey 1.19. Also for our client side stuff we're using ExtJS.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My ExtJS request is formatted as so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>Ext.Ajax.request({&#xA;url: 'rest/RestClass/getMessage',&#xA;method: 'PUT',&#xA;header: {&#xA;    'Content-Type': 'application/json'&#xA;},&#xA;jsonData: {&#xA;    status: {&#xA;        id: 1,&#xA;        description: 'Description'&#xA;    }&#xA;},&#xA;success: function(response) {&#xA;    var result = response.responseText;&#xA;},&#xA;failure: function(response) {&#xA;    Ext.Msg.alert('Communication Error', 'Failed');&#xA;}&#xA;});&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As far as my back end stuff goes I have this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>@PUT&#xA;@Path("/getMessage")&#xA;@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)&#xA;public void getMsg(JAXBElement&lt;Status&gt; status) {&#xA;    System.out.println("status id = " + status.getValue().getId());&#xA;    System.out.println("status description = " + status.getValue().getDescription());&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also my Status object is:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>@XmlRootElement&#xA;public class Status{&#xA;&#xA;    private int id;&#xA;    private String description;&#xA;&#xA;    public Status() {&#xA;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public void setId(int id) {&#xA;        this.id = id;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public int getId() {&#xA;        return id;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public void setDescription(String description) {&#xA;        this.description = description;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public String getDescription() {&#xA;        return description;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have properly mapped the jersey servlet etc since I've already sent successful requests.

<p>I ran into this issue, in which I had a small number of fields I wanted to exclude only from serialization, so I developed a fairly simple solution that uses Gson's <code>@Expose</code> annotation with custom exclusion strategies.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The only built-in way to use <code>@Expose</code> is by setting <code>GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithoutExposeAnnotation()</code>, but as the name indicates, fields without an explicit <code>@Expose</code> are ignored. As I only had a few fields I wanted to exclude, I found the prospect of adding the annotation to every field very cumbersome.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I effectively wanted the inverse, in which everything was included unless I explicitly used <code>@Expose</code> to exclude it. I used the following exclusion strategies to accomplish this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>new GsonBuilder()&#xA;        .addSerializationExclusionStrategy(new ExclusionStrategy() {&#xA;            @Override&#xA;            public boolean shouldSkipField(FieldAttributes fieldAttributes) {&#xA;                final Expose expose = fieldAttributes.getAnnotation(Expose.class);&#xA;                return expose != null &amp;&amp; !expose.serialize();&#xA;            }&#xA;&#xA;            @Override&#xA;            public boolean shouldSkipClass(Class&lt;?&gt; aClass) {&#xA;                return false;&#xA;            }&#xA;        })&#xA;        .addDeserializationExclusionStrategy(new ExclusionStrategy() {&#xA;            @Override&#xA;            public boolean shouldSkipField(FieldAttributes fieldAttributes) {&#xA;                final Expose expose = fieldAttributes.getAnnotation(Expose.class);&#xA;                return expose != null &amp;&amp; !expose.deserialize();&#xA;            }&#xA;&#xA;            @Override&#xA;            public boolean shouldSkipClass(Class&lt;?&gt; aClass) {&#xA;                return false;&#xA;            }&#xA;        })&#xA;        .create();&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I can easily exclude a few fields with <code>@Expose(serialize = false)</code> or <code>@Expose(deserialize = false)</code> annotations (note that the default value for both <code>@Expose</code> attributes is <code>true</code>). You can of course use <code>@Expose(serialize = false, deserialize = false)</code>, but that is more concisely accomplished by declaring the field <code>transient</code> instead (which does still take effect with these custom exclusion strategies).</p>&#xA;

<p>The original answer is certainly correct, but you may want to keep in mind that it will not show you 'ties for first'.  A sentence like</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><code>A life in the present is a present itself.</code></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Will only reveal either 'a' or 'present' to be the number one hit.

a sentence like
a life in the present is a present itself
will only reveal either a or present to be the number one hit
in fact since dictionaries are generally unordered the result you see may not even be the first word that s repeated multiple times
if you need to report on multiples might i suggest the following
1 use your current method of key-value pairs for word hits
2 determine the greatest value for hits
3 check for the number of values that equal the greatest number of hits and add those keys to a list
4 iterate through the list to display the words with the greatest number of hits
par example
depending on python 2.7 or python 3 your mileage and syntax may vary
but ideally - imho - you d first want to determine the greatest number of hits and then just go back and add the relevant entries to a new list

<p>With the Array object methods you can modify the Array content yet compared to the basic for loops, these methods lack one important functionality. You can not modify the index on the run.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example if you will remove the current element and place it to another index position within the same array you can easily do this. If you move the current element to a previous position there is no problem in the next iteration you will get the same next item as if you hadn't done anything.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Consider this code where we move the item at index position 5 to index position 2 once the index counts up to 5.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>var ar = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];&#xA;ar.forEach((e,i,a) =&gt; {&#xA;i == 5 &amp;&amp; a.splice(2,0,a.splice(i,1)[0])&#xA;console.log(i,e);&#xA;}); // 0 0 - 1 1 - 2 2 - 3 3 - 4 4 - 5 5 - 6 6 - 7 7 - 8 8 - 9 9&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However if we move the current element to somewhere beyond the current index position things get a little messy.

<p>After some conversations with the creator of LuaJ, we determined that the problem came from a change that was made starting in version 3.0-alpha1 where lua's <strong>package.path</strong> was being ignored when loading a script via <strong>require</strong>.  What this means is that require will only look in the path "." when searching for scripts.  If there are scripts called from a sub-directory, call it "place" then <strong>require</strong> could find those scripts by loading them with the dot operator:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>require( "place.thingy" );&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The reason, I suspect, that the number of issues with this <strong>package.path</strong> issue have been somewhat scarce in the community is because there is a way to set the path from the Java side that works in previous releases of LuaJ v3.0.  (I will post an update on the proper way to do this once I have figured it out, as I am still unclear on the process.)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The long and short of the whole situation is that there should be a LuaJ v3.0-alpha3 on the way soon which allows the <strong>package.path</strong> to be set from lua.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks again to Jim Roseborough for working with me to resolve the issue.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Note from Jim Roseborough: As Nathan mentioned, this was indeed a bug in luaj-3.0-alpha2 and before.  This has been fixed and should work as expected in luaj-3.0-beta1 and later which is now available.</p>&#xA;

<p>Does anyone know how to make an event loop in c++ without a library? It doesn't have to be cross-platform, I'm on a Mac. Basically, I want the program to run and do nothing until the user presses the up arrow key, then the program will output "You pressed up" or something. All i can think of is having an infinite <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> loop and get input with <code>cin</code>, but I don't think <code>cin</code> can detect arrow keys and I believe it pauses the program until it reaches a '\n';</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would want it to look like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>void RUN()&#xA;{&#xA;   while(true)&#xA;   {&#xA;      // poll events and do something if needed&#xA;   }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;int main()&#xA;{&#xA;   RUN();&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm kinda sure it's possible without threads, and I've heard that this can be accomplished with <code>fd_set</code> or something, but I'm not sure how.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The program <em>has</em> to run in the background when there aren't any events.

<p>From the question it seems you are interested if the vector elements are consective integers. If that is the case you can use a flag to indicate if the condition holds and do a single iteration:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>bool consecutive = false;&#xA;for (int i = 1; i &lt; v.size(); ++i) {&#xA;  if (v[i] != v[i - 1] + 1) {&#xA;    consecutive = false;&#xA;    break;&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;if (consecutive) {&#xA;   cout &lt;&lt; v.back() &lt;&lt; endl; // the last element is the biggest.&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However your question title suggests you are interested in checking if the vector is sorted. If that is the case you can use the built-in function <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/is_sorted/" rel="nofollow">std::is_sorted</a> that is present since c++11.</p>&#xA;

<p>As the error is telling you, you absolutely can not have a parameterless instance constructor for a struct.

<p>Pardon me if I question your H-decrement logic. Assuming your <code>H</code> and <code>W</code> are zero-based (and they should be), I believe this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>for(H = h; H &gt;=1; H--)&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>would be far better served as this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>H = h;&#xA;while (H--)&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>if it is really the intend of backward-enumerator <code>H-1</code> down to <code>0</code>. (and I think it should be). Fix that I and I'm fairly sure you can properly allocate your buffer. As written, the expectation is you're searching in the <code>H</code>th row, to start your loop, and such a row is not in your buffer.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If a for-loop is mandatory, it actually involves <em>more</em> work. Something as seemingly innocent as this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>for(H=(h-1); H&gt;=0; --H)&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>will not work</strong> as a universal mechanism. What happens when <code>h</code>, and unsigned type, is <code>0</code> to start with?. The expression <code>(h-1)</code> would introduce an underflow. Ouch. Certainly you could "fix" this by doing something like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>if (h)&#xA;{&#xA;    for(H=(h-1); H&gt;=0; --H)&#xA;    ....&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>but that is just piling more cruft on what was originally a bad idea.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The following <em>will</em> work, but is considerably less clear imho:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>for (H=h; H--;)&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>this accomplishes the same logic as our while-loop, at the cost of obfuscation. The one (and only) thing it brings to the table is local-var-declaration, which <em>can</em> be helpful:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>for (dword var=h; var--;)&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There are many ways to do this, these but a few.

<p>Hiding the children of the div works fine for me... Just use <code>$("#bs-navbar-search").children().hide();</code> to hide the elements within the div. Run the code snippet and see for yourself (it doesn't show anything because it is hiding the elements). Are you sure you are using the jQuery library and have linked your javascript source correctly? Also your javascript/jQuery code you used has commas which you shouldn't use, but I'm not sure if you did that just to show us what you have tried or if that is your actual code.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Anyway, this should do this trick:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">&#xD;&#xA;<div class="snippet-code">&#xD;&#xA;<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>$("#bs-navbar-search").children().hide();</code></pre>&#xD;&#xA;<pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;div class="collapse navbar-collapse searchbar-navbar" id="bs-navbar-search"&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;form class="navbar-form navbar-left" role="search"&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Search" id="navbar-search-box"&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-default"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/form&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>&#xD;&#xA;</div>&#xD;&#xA;</div>&#xD;&#xA;</p>&#xA;

<p>The whole point of enclosing stuff into IIFEs is to isolate them and not pollute the global environment with unnecessaries. For example,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>var counter = (function() {&#xA;  var current = 0;&#xA;  function getCurrentAndIncrement() {&#xA;    return current++;&#xA;  };&#xA;  return getCurrentAndIncrement;&#xA;})();&#xA;&#xA;counter()&#xA;// 0&#xA;counter()&#xA;// 1&#xA;current&#xA;// ReferenceError: current is not defined&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We hide what should be private, and expose what should be public.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You hid everything - then the fact that it is inaccessible should not be a surprise.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Finally, <code>&lt;div id="div0" ondrop="drop(event)"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> is a bad practice. Binding event listeners from JavaScript is much better, if a bit more complicated. Do just this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;div id="div0"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>then in JavaScript,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>var div0 = document.getElementById('div0');&#xA;div0.addEventListener('drop', myHandler);&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>and this can, indeed, be stuffed into an IIFE. Whatever you refer to from HTML (as in your <code>drop</code> function) needs to be in global scope, or the browser will not be able to find it.</p>&#xA;

hey guys in relation to this stackoverflow question how would i go about creating my own visual studio 2008 plug-in
i ve checked the visual studio developer centre on msdn but the amount of info is overwhelming
there are loads of project types and i don t even know where to start
where should i start looking if i want to write something which meets the following requirements
a plug-in that runs like a service in visual studio and is able to poll visual studio for information and handle visual studio events
the info i d like to access from vs are things like what projects are currently open who has them open and other solution project file based info
the events i d like to be able to handle are things like the opening closing editing creating deleting of solutions projects individual files
i d also like to be able to handle any interaction with vs on a per solution basis
so i d like to handle any interaction with files even code editing but also just other interaction like with the menus or just the ide itself
as well as these i d also like to be able to store data somewhere
where is this usually done
can i add metadata to the solution file
or does it make sense to save this info to a small local instance of a database that is somehow attached to the solution.
i just need a push in the right direction is any of this possible
what part of the visual studio developer centre should i focus on
what apis should i check out
cheers

<p>I'm creating an object stack which uses a doubly linked list in order to reference the bottom objects as they are popped off the stack. My dilemma is that I have multiple classes which take in objects as parameters. The objects represent instances of the other classes so they are not accepted as parameters into a different class unless the methods and fields of that receiving class are declared with the name of the sending class. I don't want the classes to be dependent off of each other since I want to use the doubly linked list later on in other programs. So I am contemplating writing generics into my program or casting the objects. Which do you think is the better choice and why? Also how would the approach be implemented? </p>&#xA;

is
a code question below
calculate a + b and output the sum in standard format -- that is the digits must be separated into groups of three by commas unless there are less than four digits
input
each input file contains one test case
each case contains a pair of integers a and b where -1000000 a b 1000000
the numbers are separated by a space
output
for each test case you should output the sum of a and b in one line
the sum must be written in the standard format
sample input
-1000000 9
sample output
-999 991

So if you want to mark a point as invalid, you should first include <code>&lt;limits&gt;</code> file and then set the positions to 'std::numeric_limits::quiet_NaN()'. It is usually done like this</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>const float bad_point = std::numeric_limits&lt;float&gt;::quiet_NaN();&#xA;if( is_invalid_point )&#xA;    p.x = p.y = p.z = bad_point;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But anyway, configuring ICP can be a pain. You may have to do a lot more parameter tweaking depending on your data.</p>&#xA;

<p>There is no feature in the IDE which will do what you want. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</Kbd> to generate getters and setters from a <code>property</code> declaration.

How can the IDE be expected to know how you wish to implement your getter and setter. It cannot be expected to know which field you intend to use. Your code is a good demonstration of why that is so. There is no obvious algorithmic relationship between the property name and the field name. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Another point to make is that if you want the IDE to generate the code for getter and setter in your question automatically, why do you even bother with a getter and setter?

<p>By default, widgets in a <code>TableRow</code> have <code>android:layout_width="wrap_content"</code>.

<p>You can try this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>$query-&gt;execute(array(":$column" =&gt; "{$term}%"));&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The <code>LIKE</code> operator needs to know what parts of the values, in the rows, it should ignore.

<p>From <a href="http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips14/CN04.pdf">this</a>, we know:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>The convergence of Q-learning holds using any exploration policy, and only requires that each state action pair <code>(s,a)</code> is executed <strong>infinitely often</strong>. </p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The <code>epsilon-greedy policy</code> is a balance between exploration and exploitation, which both guarantees convergence and often good performance. But in practical problems, we often need some heuristics to change the learning speed <code>alpha</code> to represent a better return. Otherwise, the <code>infinite often</code> requirement is hard to meet. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I list an example below. This is a classical problem, in which you have a grid and you have possibly different reward amount in each cell. For instance, a 4x4 grid is shown below, in which every cell contains a reward of <code>1</code>, except the top-left cell (you have a bigger reward with an amount of <code>10</code>). A robot is moving in the grid. The legal actions are moving <code>LEFT</code>, <code>RIGHT</code>, <code>UP</code> and <code>DOWN</code>, but the robot cannot move out of the grid. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So our state space contains 16 distinct states, which corresponds to the 16 cells. For each state, there are different number of legal actions because of the border constraint. Our goal is to calculate the optimal policy (given any state <code>s</code>, output an optimal action <code>a</code>).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>+++++++++++++++++++++&#xA;+ 10 +  1 +  1 + 1  +&#xA;+++++++++++++++++++++&#xA;+ 1  +  1 +  1 + 1  +&#xA;+++++++++++++++++++++&#xA;+ 1  +  1 +  1 + 1  +&#xA;+++++++++++++++++++++&#xA;+ 1  +  1 +  1 + 1  +&#xA;+++++++++++++++++++++&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Suppose we use an <code>epsilon-greedy policy</code> with <code>epsilon=0.1</code>, a constant learning rate <code>alpha=0.1</code>. We start with a random position on the grid. Whenever we reach the top-left corner, we restart with a random position again.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Below is a result of running a simulation of 200,000 moves. The left-most block shows visually the current greedy policy at each cell.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><code>--&gt;</code> Moving right</li>&#xA;<li><code>&lt;--</code> Moving left</li>&#xA;<li><code>^</code> Moving up</li>&#xA;<li><code>v</code> Moving down</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So you see this is far from an optimal policy. Obviously in an optimal policy, every cell should point to either left or up because we have a significant bigger reward at position <code>(0,0)</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code> v   v   v   v   |      2      9      5      4   &#xA; v   v   v   v   |     14     98     75     14   &#xA;--&gt;  v   v  &lt;--  |    258   3430   3312    245  &#xA;--&gt; --&gt; &lt;-- &lt;--  |   3270  93143  92978   3191  &#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The right block shows how many times we visit each cell so far. You see that we spend most of the visits at the bottom but we visit the top row very rare. This is why we have not reached the optimal policy yet. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If we change the learning rate to be <code>alpha=1/(number of times you visited (s,a) so far)</code>, we are able to reach the optimal policy (shown below) within 20,000 steps. Also the number of times we visited each cell are distributed more uniformly though not perfect.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code> --&gt; &lt;-- &lt;-- &lt;--  |     34   7997   7697    294 &#xA;  ^   ^   ^  &lt;--  |    731    898    524    132 &#xA;  ^   ^   ^   ^   |    709    176     88     94 &#xA;  ^   ^   ^   ^   |    245    256     96     77  &#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For a larger problem with more states, e.g., a 10x10 grids, I find it's better to use larger <code>epsilon</code>.

below is a result of running a simulation of 200 000 moves

so you see this is far from an optimal policy

the right block shows how many times we visit each cell so far
you see that we spend most of the visits at the bottom but we visit the top row very rare
this is why we have not reached the optimal policy yet
if we change the learning rate to be we are able to reach the optimal policy shown below within 20 000 steps
also the number of times we visited each cell are distributed more uniformly though not perfect

I have 4 tables of data that I'm trying to send (user, building, room, device).&#xA;Here is how I am currently outputting the JSON data:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>    // Users&#xA;    $query = "SELECT * from user";&#xA;    $result = mysql_query($query,$conn) or die('Errant query:  '.$query);&#xA;&#xA;    $users = array();&#xA;    if(mysql_num_rows($result)) {&#xA;      while($user = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {&#xA;      $users[] = array('user'=&gt;$user);&#xA;      }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    // Buildings&#xA;    $query = "SELECT * from building";&#xA;    $result = mysql_query($query,$conn) or die('Errant query:  '.$query);&#xA;&#xA;    $buildings = array();&#xA;    if(mysql_num_rows($result)) {&#xA;      while($building = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {&#xA;       $buildings[] = array('building'=&gt;$building);&#xA;     }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    // Rooms&#xA;    $query = "SELECT * from room";&#xA;    $result = mysql_query($query,$conn) or die('Errant query:  '.$query);&#xA;&#xA;    $rooms = array();&#xA;    if(mysql_num_rows($result)) {&#xA;     while($room = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {&#xA;      $rooms[] = array('room'=&gt;$room);&#xA;     }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    // Devices&#xA;    $query = "SELECT * from device";&#xA;    $result = mysql_query($query,$conn) or die('Errant query:  '.$query);&#xA;&#xA;    $devices = array();&#xA;    if(mysql_num_rows($result)) {&#xA;     while($device = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {&#xA;      $devices[] = array('device'=&gt;$device);&#xA;     }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    header('Content-type: application/json');&#xA;    echo json_encode(array('users'=&gt;$users));&#xA;    echo json_encode(array('buildings'=&gt;$buildings));&#xA;    echo json_encode(array('rooms'=&gt;$rooms));&#xA;    echo json_encode(array('devices'=&gt;$devices)); &#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I fear that this method isn't the right way to send multiple objects.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2) In the iOS app, how can I automatically take this JSON data and insert it into the corresponding local database tables in SQLite?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks for any help.</p>&#xA;

<p>I'm trying to pick a JS template engine for an upcoming project and one of my favorites seems to be <a href="http://akdubya.github.io/dustjs/" rel="nofollow">dust.js</a>. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I like the idea that it's asynchronous, i.e. I just stage some template for rendering and when it's ready the callback inserts the rendered HTML into the DOM.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm not sure however how to work around the problem of asynchronous rendering within synchronous callbacks.

<p>So another option is to create an entirely separate page with the editable form. Say form.php with code like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>  &lt;form action="whatever.php" method="POST"&gt;&#xA;     &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;       &lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;&#xA;       &lt;input type="text" value="&lt;?php echo $name; ?&gt;"/&gt;&#xA;       &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;       &lt;li&gt;&#xA;         &lt;label&gt;Age:&lt;/label&gt;&#xA;         &lt;input type="text" value="&lt;?php echo $age; ?&gt;"/&gt;&#xA;       &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;       etc &#xA; &lt;/form&gt;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then on your display page you can add a button named edit and load the form using AJAX like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>   $("#editButton").click(function(){&#xA;       $("#student-infomercial").load("form.php");&#xA;   });&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This way the entire display is replaced with a form.

i want to build a cocoa app with a list of entries very similar to the todo list of things.app see the screencast
the question is whether i should use
a tableview
a collectionview or
a webview
i think it could work with all of them but which one suits the following requirements best
have a list of entries - 1 column many rows
reordering with drag drop
select single entries use keys for actions like delete
open up an entry the row should expand to show more input fields
customized look rounded corners shadow background gradient
so far my research says that the tableview has most of the functionality but is harder to customize in its appearance the collectionview doesn t have drag drop right
but is easy to design and the webview would take much effort to not hurt the user experience and i can t bind my model directly to input fields
what pros and cons am i missing and what would you recommend to use

<p>What happens in your case is that the encoding of the CSV and the encoding of your page (html) do not match... you either make sure that both use the same encoding OR you convert the encoding of the CSV on reading. I don't know which class/library you use <code>CsvFileReader</code> but the easiest way would be to open the CSV with the correct encoding for example with a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamreader.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>StreamReader</code></a> instead of <code>ABSFilePath</code> as parameter...</p>&#xA;

declare them as
when you assign i k and next you need to use blocking assignments
non-blocking postpones the update
each loop will be evaluate i + 1
with their pre- negedge key0 value
blocking assignments should also be used in your assignments to move and bits for the same reason as i k and next
i and next needs be be set to 0 and 1 for each loop of k
bits is assigned two different always blocks therefore it can not synthesize
the k loop cannot static unroll which also means it will not synthesize
you can resolve points 2 3 4 and 5 by moving the looping logic from the always negedge key0 into the bottom of the always_comb that already assigns bits
then change the non-blocking to blocking for the moved logic
as far as i know not every synthesizer supports while-loops
even if your synthesizer supports while-loops it must static unroll
a requirement for all synthesizable loops
i m guessing this is an assignment where your instructor asked you do do a shifter without for-loops
there are is a way to do this assignment without any loops and it can be down with significantly fewer lines of code and variables than you currently have
i will not give you the code because i think this is homework
i will suggest that look into and compare the concepts of
case statements
the down shift and arithmetic down shift operators
part-select addressing + can also be called range-slicing
you may also want to read up on bit concatenations ex and replicators ex

<p>Your <code>foo</code> function works fine.  However, within the loop, the output of <code>foo</code> only gets assigned to one variable, even though you are trying to place both values from <code>foo</code> into a row in your matrix.  This is a technicality with MATLAB that may seem annoying at first.  It's actually treating the entire row of your matrix as a single variable, and so we are only getting the first variable from <code>foo</code>.  The second variable gets discarded.

<p>Note that "same coordinate" is actually somewhat ambiguous. If one turtles <code>ycor</code> is <code>5.0000001</code> and another's is <code>5.0000000</code>, are they at the same coordinate? Because of this, you should check to see if their coordinates are within a certain amount of each other.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, the best way to stop moving is to simply not move. So, here is a possible <code>go</code> procedure that would do what you want:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>to go&#xA;  ask turtles [&#xA;    if not any? turtles with [ breed != [ breed ] of myself and abs (ycor - [ ycor ] of myself) &lt; threshold ] [&#xA;      move ;; replace with your move procedure or code&#xA;    ]&#xA;  ]&#xA;end&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here, each turtle checks to see if there are any turtles of a different breed who's <code>ycor</code> is within <code>threshold</code> of their own <code>ycor</code>.

 note that "same coordinate" is actually somewhat ambiguous. if one turtles  ycor  is  5.0000001  and another's is  5.0000000 , are they at the same coordinate? because of this, you should check to see if their coordinates are within a certain amount of each other. . ;. ; also, the best way to stop moving is to simply not move. so, here is a possible  go  procedure that would do what you want: . ;. ;  . ;. ; here, each turtle checks to see if there are any turtles of a different breed who's  ycor  is within  threshold  of their own  ycor . if there are not, then it moves. otherwise, it does nothing. . ;. ; the   myself   stuff is the most confusing part here, so i recommend reading the docs. . ;

<p>I don't think that <code>wget</code> supports it, but it's possible to do with a small shell script.&#xA;First, create an input file like this (<code>inputfile.txt</code>):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>http://www.example.com/file1.mpg    filename_to_save_as1.mpg&#xA;http://www.example.com/file2.mpg    filename_to_save_as2.mpg&#xA;http://www.example.com/file3.mpg    filename_to_save_as3.mpg&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The url and the filename are separated by a <code>tab</code> character.&#xA;Then use this bash script (<code>wget2.sh</code>):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>#!/bin/bash&#xA;while read line&#xA;do&#xA;    URL=$(echo "$line" | cut -f 1 )&#xA;    FILENAME=$(echo "$line" | cut -f 2 )&#xA;    echo wget -c --load-cookies cookies.txt "$URL" -O "$FILENAME"&#xA;done&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>with this command:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>echo input.txt | wget2.sh&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A more simple solution is to write a shell script which contains the <code>wget</code> command for every file:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>#!/bin/bash&#xA;wget -c --load-cookies cookies.txt http://www.example.com/file.mpg1 -O filename_to_save_as1.mpg&#xA;wget -c --load-cookies cookies.txt http://www.example.com/file.mpg2 -O filename_to_save_as2.mpg&#xA;wget -c --load-cookies cookies.txt http://www.example.com/file.mpg3 -O filename_to_save_as3.mpg&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;

<p>Your problem is caused by ambiguity about what <code>PARAM</code> is in the procedure's SELECT statement:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE&#xA;PROCEDURE GetCol(PARAM IN STRING, recordset OUT sys_refcursor)&#xA;AS&#xA;BEGIN&#xA;OPEN recordset FOR&#xA;SELECT DISTINCT(PARAM) -- Ambiguity here&#xA;FROM my_table;&#xA;END;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does <code>PARAM</code> refer to the table column or to the first parameter of the procedure?  Oracle has assumed the parameter. You can explicitly say which like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT(my_table.PARAM) &#xA;FROM my_table;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You could if appropriate (it probably isn't here) specify the procedure parameter instead:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT(GetCol.PARAM) &#xA;FROM my_table;&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Generally this is best avoided by:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>always using table aliases in column references select statements, and</li>&#xA;<li>having a standard for parameter names that makes them less likely to clash e.g. P_PARAM.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;

<p>I have two generators <code>genA</code> and <code>genB</code> and each of them generates an infinite, strictly monotonically increasing sequence of integers.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I need a generator that generates all tuples <code>(a, b)</code> such that <code>a</code> is produced by <code>genA</code> and <code>b</code> is produced by <code>genB</code> and <code>a &lt; b</code>, ordered by <code>a + b</code> ascending. In case of ambiguity the ordering is of no importance, i.e. if <code>a + b == c + d</code>, it doesn't matter if it generates <code>(a, b)</code> first or <code>(c, d)</code> first.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For instance. If both <code>genA</code> and <code>genB</code> generate the prime numbers, then the new generator should generate:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>(2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 5), (2, 7), (3, 7), (5, 7), (2, 11), ...&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If <code>genA</code> and <code>genB</code> were finite lists, zipping and then sorting would do the trick.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Apparenyly for all tuples of form <code>(x, b)</code> the following holds: <code>first(genA) &lt;= x &lt;= max(genA,b) &lt;= b</code>, being <code>first(genA)</code> the first element generated by <code>genA</code> and <code>max(genA,b)</code> the last element generated by <code>genA</code> which is less than <code>b</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is how far I have gotten. Any ideas of how to combine two generators in the described manner?</p>&#xA;
